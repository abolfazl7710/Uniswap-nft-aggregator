 With the launch Uniswap NFT Aggregator on the Ethereum Mainnet announced that it will distribute 5 million USDC to historical users of the Genie aggregator. The snapshot was taken on April 15, 2022 at 00:00 UTC. According to the announcement, those that included airdrops were categorized into three tires. The first tier was the users who had done the transaction before the snapshot, each of which included 300 USDC. The second tier was the users who were Genesis Genie NFT holders at the time of the snapshot, and each included 1000 USDC. And the third tier were users who were both in tier one and in tier two, each of whom received 1,300 USDC.
